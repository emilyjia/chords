# chords project

Given a spotify username and playlist name, returns the chord progressions for songs in the playlist.

## inspo

I've been playing a lot of ukulele to keep me sane during my job search. Many of my favorite songs use similar chord progressions. I wondered what the true distribution of chord progressions was across my playlists. 

## todo

- Add examples
- Add major/minor key identifier. Current guesser identifies the major key, so the chord numbers look wonky for minor songs.
- Improve pattern detection. Songs commonly have multiple chord progressions of varying lengths. I currently assume that the progression does not have repeat chords (e.g. I would miss I/I/IV/V) and has fixed length. 
- More chord information (e.g. currently read Asus9 as A)
- Playlist creation
